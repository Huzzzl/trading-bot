# Live Readiness Status

Current operational status of the live-readiness gate baseline.
Last updated: 2026-05-19.

## Current Status

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Gate baseline | Complete |
| Current decision | **NO-GO** |
| Approx readiness | ~78% |
| Live submit | Not allowed. Not implemented. |

No live order submission is possible or planned in the current codebase.
The gate is read-only infrastructure only.

## Latest Gate Result

```
=== Live Readiness Gate ===
  account_check           : WARN
  shadow_preflight        : FAIL
  shadow_review           : FAIL
  symbol_screen           : WARN
  symbol_screen_review    : FAIL

  decision: NO-GO
  top_blockers:
    ! [account_check] buying_power=0, portfolio_value=0
    ! [shadow_review] [live_sizing] SPY candidates exceed live_max_notional=500.0
    ! [symbol_screen_review] No symbols currently suitable under current live sizing limits.
============================
```

## Current Blockers

| Blocker | Stage |
|---------|-------|
| `buying_power=0` | account_check |
| `portfolio_value=0` | account_check |
| SPY candidates exceed `live_max_notional=500.0` | shadow_preflight / shadow_review |
| No suitable symbols under current universe / sizing limits | symbol_screen / symbol_screen_review |

These blockers are **expected** at this stage. The live account has not been funded.
Do not raise `live_max_notional` or adjust sizing limits to artificially force GO.

## Safety Baseline Completed

The following read-only checks and guards are implemented and tested:

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Paper canary buy/close validated | End-to-end paper order lifecycle |
| Paper ledger verify | Ledger row written and verified |
| Paper daily limits | `paper_daily_max_orders`, `paper_daily_max_buy_orders`, `paper_daily_max_close_orders` |
| Market-hours guard | `paper_require_market_hours` |
| Open-order guard | `paper_block_if_open_orders` |
| Kill switch | `paper_kill_switch_enabled` |
| `live_account_check` | Credentials + account health (read-only) |
| `live_shadow_preflight` | Strategy preview + live account state (read-only) |
| `live_shadow_review` | Artifact review of preflight output (read-only) |
| `live_shadow_screen_symbols` | Multi-symbol live sizing screen (read-only) |
| `live_shadow_screen_review` | Artifact review of symbol screen output (read-only) |
| `live_readiness_gate` | Unified GO/NO-GO gate across all five checks (read-only) |

## Required Conditions Before Considering Live Submit Design

All of the following must be true before any live submit design work begins.
Each is a hard prerequisite — not a suggestion.

1. **Live account funded and activated** — `buying_power` and `portfolio_value` both non-zero.
2. **`live_readiness_gate` returns GO** — all five stages must PASS.
3. **At least one suitable symbol** — at least one symbol in the configured universe passes live sizing under current `live_max_notional`.
4. **Explicit human approval** — a human operator reviews the gate output and approves proceeding.
5. **Separate PR for live submit design** — live order submission must be designed and reviewed in its own dedicated PR, never silently added to an existing tool.
6. **Live safeguards must exist first** — a live kill switch, live ledger, and live dry-run mode must be implemented and verified before any submit path is added.

## Gate Command

```bash
export ALPACA_LIVE_API_KEY="your-live-api-key"
export ALPACA_LIVE_SECRET_KEY="your-live-secret-key"

python -m src.tools.live_readiness_gate \
    --config     config/settings.paper.local.yaml \
    --output-dir output/live_readiness_gate
```

### Audit artifact locations

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Gate report | `output/live_readiness_gate/live_readiness_gate_report.json` |
| Preflight report | `output/live_readiness_gate/live_shadow_preflight_report.json` |
| Preflight candidates | `output/live_readiness_gate/live_shadow_candidates.csv` |
| Symbol screen report | `output/live_readiness_gate/live_shadow_symbol_screen_report.json` |
| Symbol screen summary | `output/live_readiness_gate/live_shadow_symbol_screen.csv` |

### Optional history log

To track gate results over time, add `--append-history`:

```bash
python -m src.tools.live_readiness_gate \
    --config         config/settings.paper.local.yaml \
    --output-dir     output/live_readiness_gate \
    --append-history output/live_readiness_history.csv
```

Each run appends one row to the CSV (header written on first use).
The CSV is never read by the gate — it is a plain audit trail only.
History logging never causes the gate to fail.

### Clear credentials when done

```bash
unset ALPACA_LIVE_API_KEY
unset ALPACA_LIVE_SECRET_KEY
```

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:\ALPACA_LIVE_API_KEY    -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item Env:\ALPACA_LIVE_SECRET_KEY -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Warnings

> **Do not raise `live_max_notional` to force GO.**
> The current notional cap exists for safety. Only raise it after a full funding
> and risk review, and only after the live account carries real buying power.

> **Do not bypass NO-GO.**
> A NO-GO decision is not a configuration problem to be worked around.
> It means the account or sizing conditions are not ready for live trading.

> **Do not add live submit in this phase.**
> The current codebase has no live order submission path. Adding one requires
> its own PR, its own safeguards, and explicit human sign-off as listed above.
